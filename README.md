ASTREA
======

A set of goodies for web development in the form of jQuery Widgets


Why Astrea?
----------

Because there is always something missing... even in the best libraries, like jQuery UI.

I always try to make my life easy, in the good sense of the word... and this library
is the result of this way to see the life. The code written here was done in my spare time
and I believed I could use it as a project of end of Career, long time ago.

There is always out there plugins or widgets or plain javascript code that do the same
this library do. Even better. But I try to focus on the ease of use which I personally
believe is the most important part on a library.

This project has the intention to have unit tests when possible and make use of HTML5, CSS3
And run on most browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera an IE 8+) 

So... no more to say... happy coding.
